Problem 1:
Fetch date and temperature from temperature_data where zip code is greater than
300000 and less than 399999.

hive> SELECT date,temperature FROM temperature_data WHERE zip_code BETWEEN 300000 AND 399999;

Problem 2:
Calculate maximum temperature corresponding to every year from temperature_data
table.

hive> SELECT max(temperature) FROM temperature_data group by date;

Problem 3:
Calculate maximum temperature from temperature_data table corresponding to those
years which have at least 2 entries in the table

hive> select max(temperature),rank(zip_code) as rank FROM temperature_data group by date where rank>=2;

Problem 4:
Create a view on the top of last query, name it temperature_data_vw.

hive> create view temperature_data_vw as select max(temperature),rank(zip_code) as rank FROM temperature_data group by date where rank>=2;

Problem 5:
Export contents from temperature_data_vw to a file in local file system, such that each
file is '|' delimited.

hive> INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '/home/acadgild/hive' 
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' 
select * from temperature_data_vw;
